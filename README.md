# climrods
 Python module for efficiently downloading NLDAS forcing data
 
 Currently, the tool requires that you can provide a shapefile for the watershed(s) you are interested in. Future development will provide functionality to delineate watersheds within the tool.
 
 Currently, the tool only downloads and analyzes precipitation data, but other parameters will be included in the future.

The NLDAS grid shapefile is required for using this tool. It is available in the sample_data folder or can be downloaded here: https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/faq/nldas

See main.py for an example importing and using the tool.
